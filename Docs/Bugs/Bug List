	1.	@prose matching fails when the block contains nesting like this "" [ ] ""

2.	@text matching fails entirely (although @string matching will correctly accept text)

3.	The progress mark should skip over text blocks and {} blocks.  It doesn't.

4.	Phrases need to set value = null after being applied (unless they're ordinary SimplePhrases).
	Otherwise, weird data shows up in the debugger.
