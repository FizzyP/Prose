	1.	@prose matching fails when the block contains nesting like this "" [ ] ""

2.	@text matching fails entirely (although @string matching will correctly accept text)

3.	The progress mark should skip over text blocks and {} blocks.  It doesn't.

	4.	Phrases need to set value = null after being applied (unless they're ordinary SimplePhrases).
		Otherwise, weird data shows up in the debugger.

5.	Check that word creating phrases and other early written phrases aren't explicitly overwriting their delimiters.

6.	Pattern matcher matching across terminal period causes the word: a, b, c. word: e, f, g. problem.

7.	When parentheses are eliminated, sometimes pattern matchers retain references to them in TerminatorNode.  This causes a null reference exception when one attempts to extract the last argument from the matcher: the search never ends because it's looking for a parenthesis that isn't there.
